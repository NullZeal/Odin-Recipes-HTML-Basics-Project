Exposing my basic knowledge of HTML

In [this project](https://nullzeal.github.io/Odin-Recipes-HTML-Basics-Project/), I created a very basic website using some HTML and CSS basic knowledge.

##Included : 

- A file structure for the project (pages will linked with anchor using relative links)
- Html structure for pages
- Content on the pages (images, lists)
