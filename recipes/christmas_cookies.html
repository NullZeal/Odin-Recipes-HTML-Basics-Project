        Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years. <br><br>I sprinkle with colored sugar before baking or you could also try icing them when cool. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <li> <h3>Step 1 : </h3>
            <p>
                Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours.
                Step 2
                
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.
                Step 3
                
                Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
